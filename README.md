This project is a technical documentation page created as a certification requirement for the Responsive Web Design course from freeCodeCamp. The page documents the Nintendo 64 user manual and adheres to the functional requirements of the freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page while allowing for personal design and subject choice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. While freeCodeCamp provides guidelines and user stories for certification projects, it does not offer tutorials or step-by-step guides for development. This project was built entirely from scratch using my own approach to meet the requirements.

## üìù Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to create a technical documentation page that effectively presents information about the Nintendo 64 user manual. This involved building a page similar to the <a href="https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/">freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page</a> while allowing for personal design choices and subject selection. The project focused on implementing a well-structured documentation layout, using HTML and CSS to ensure functionality and responsiveness.

## üîß Features

- **Main Content**: The page includes a `main` element with an id of `main-doc` that houses the core documentation content.

- **Section Elements**: There are multiple `section` elements with a class of `main-section`, each featuring a header that describes the topic and an id corresponding to the header text with spaces replaced by underscores.

- **Navigation Bar**:
  - Contains a `nav` element with an id of `navbar`, including a header and link elements with the class of `nav-link`.

  - The `navbar` links correspond to each `main-section` header and allow navigation to the relevant sections.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with a media query ensuring the `navbar` is shown on the left side of the screen on regular-sized devices.

## üìñ Learnings

- **HTML Structure**: Developed skills in organizing content into well-defined sections and linking navigation elements to corresponding sections.

- **Flexbox Layout**: Applied Flexbox to create a responsive and adaptable layout.

- **CSS Media Queries**: Implemented media queries to enhance the page's responsiveness and ensure proper layout adjustments for various screen sizes.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the documentation content and navigation elements.

- **CSS3** for styling and responsive design, including Flexbox and media queries.

## üí° **Acknowledgments**
